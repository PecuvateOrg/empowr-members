# Empowr Members — Context (Layer 1)

## What This Project Does

Empowr Members is the transactional platform for Empowr CIC participants: account creation, household management (parents + children), session booking with payment, monthly memberships, credits, and self-serve cancellation. It replaces the legacy Wix booking/subscription system (empowrcic.wixsite.com — account URLs broken; rebuild decided over repair). Planned domain: **members.empowrcic.org**.

## Workspace Map

| Workspace | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `planning/spec/` | Product spec — scope, offering types, business rules, phases, open questions |
| `planning/architecture/` | System design — stack, data model, Supabase access patterns, Stripe flows |
| `planning/decisions/` | ADR log |
| `src/` | Next.js project root — all application code, config, and migrations; npm commands run from here |
| `ops/` | Netlify deployment, environment variables, build config |

## External Services

| Service | Role | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Supabase (`empowr-cic`, `qrdlheqnnzpasbnayalm`) | Database + Auth; `mem_` tables; shares project with waiver + EFN tables | `_config/registry/supabase.md` |
| Stripe | One-off payments (Checkout) + per-session Subscriptions (Billing). **Account `acct_1TBhN2CpJGJ55gu5` is SHARED with Empowr Heroes** — legal entity verified 2026-08-26 as Empowr CIC. Stripe fans every event to every endpoint on it, so this app positively identifies its own objects at dispatch. | `planning/architecture/`, `_config/registry/third-party-services.md` |
| Resend | Transactional email (confirmations, cancellations) | — |
| Netlify | Hosting, members.empowrcic.org | `_config/registry/netlify-sites.md` |

## System Boundaries (Empowr estate)

- **EELA** (eela.empowrcic.org) — discovery/marketing layer; its session pages link into Members booking pages. This project fulfils EELA's planned "Phase 2 members backend"; EELA stays content-only.
- **Empowr Waivers** (waiver.empowrcic.org) — waiver capture. Same Supabase project: Members reads `people` / `waiver_responses` directly to gate first bookings.
- **Empowr Main Site** — nav account icon (parked branch `feat/my-account-nav`) activates at cutover.
- **Heroes** — shares the Stripe account only; no data coupling.

## Known Quirks

- The Supabase project is shared — never modify non-`mem_` tables from this project (waiver and EFN tables belong to their own apps)
- Roller Quad Camp and the All Ages Roller Disco are strictly non-refundable — enforced by the per-offering `refund_policy` flag, not global logic. **Every other active offering is `standard` as of 2026-09-02**, meaning a member can cancel it themselves up to 48h out for a card refund (Programme Policies v1.2). ⚠️ This line was briefly WRONG rather than merely imprecise: on 2026-09-01 all 10 offerings were set `non_refundable`, so the carve-out it describes did not exist for a day. Re-read the flags before trusting it
- Transfer (moving a booking to another date) is **BUILT as of 2026-09-17** — `mem_transfer_booking()` plus `POST /api/bookings/[id]/transfer`, gated on `mem_offerings.transferable`. Same offering, different date, **once per booking**, outside the same 48h window as cancellation; `per_run` courses are excluded. ⚠️ The flag is per-offering and member-facing copy is gated on it (`PolicyNotice` takes it as a prop), so a session only advertises a move when it actually allows one — re-read the flags before trusting any statement about which do. ⚠️ **Departure consent does NOT move with the booking**: those rows are keyed on `session_date` and the register reads them narrowed to the date, so the old consent is inert on the new date and the door correctly falls back to "collected in person". The member is told to give it again. Do not "fix" this by copying the consent across
- HAF-funded camp places stay external (app.holidayactivities.com) — link out, never book natively
- Child participant data (DOB, medical notes) is sensitive — privacy policy update via LegalHub is a launch gate

/**
 * check-auth-templates.mjs
 *
 * Run:
 *   npm run check:auth-emails
 *
 * Needs a Supabase Management API token: SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN if set,
 * otherwise the Supabase CLI's saved login (`npx supabase login`). See
 * resolveToken() in management-token.mjs.
 *
 * Compares the Supabase auth email templates LIVE on the project against the
 * output of render-auth-templates.ts in ops/auth-templates/. Exits non-zero
 * if any applied template has drifted.
 *
 * Why this exists: the auth templates are the one part of this app's email
 * surface that does not live in the codebase — Supabase stores them as
 * strings in project config. Nothing about a green build or a clean git tree
 * says the deployed template still matches the shell it was rendered from, so
 * a brand change to shell.ts silently desyncs them. This is the only check
 * that catches that.
 *
 * A template reported "not applied" is stock Supabase content, not drift.
 *
 * It ALSO checks the redirect allow list, because of a failure on 2026-09-01
 * that no template diff could have caught — see checkRedirectContract() at the
 * bottom of this file.

/**
 * The {{ .RedirectTo }} contract.
 *
 * magic_link is the ONLY template that builds its link from
 * `{{ .RedirectTo }}&token_hash=...` rather than a fixed SiteURL.
 * That is deliberate and should stay: a magic link's destination varies
 * (signing in from /login?next=/book/x has to return to that booking page),
 * and SiteURL is pinned to production so a SiteURL-based link cannot work on
 * a deploy preview at all.
 *
 * The price is a contract that nothing else enforces: the template appends
 * `&token_hash=`, so .RedirectTo MUST already contain a query string. It does
 * — LoginForm always sends `?next=` — but ONLY while the requesting origin is
 * in uri_allow_list. When it is not, Supabase silently DISCARDS the requested
 * redirect and substitutes the bare site_url, and the template then produces
 *
 *     https://members.empowrcic.org&token_hash=...&type=magiclink
 *
 * which is not a valid URL at all. The browser refuses it, so the member sees
 * a raw "invalid URL" warning rather than any error this app could word.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened on 2026-09-01 when the first Netlify branch
 * preview was tested: the preview origin was not allow-listed. Nothing in the
 * template had drifted, so the drift check above was silent — correctly, and
 * uselessly. Hence this check.
 *
 * Adding a new origin (a second custom domain, a different Netlify site, a
 * staging host) means adding it BOTH here and to uri_allow_list, or magic-link
 * sign-in from that origin ships broken.

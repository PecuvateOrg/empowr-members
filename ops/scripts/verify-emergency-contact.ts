/**
 * verify-emergency-contact.ts
 *
 * Run:
 *   npm run verify:emergency-contact
 *
 * Locks in the 2026-09-04 team safeguarding decision: an emergency contact
 * is required for EVERY skater, adults signing for themselves included.
 *
 * Why this test exists rather than just a comment: this exact rule has now
 * been changed twice in opposite directions. It was unconditional, was
 * narrowed to minors-only on 2026-08-18 (recorded as a bug fix), and was
 * widened back to everyone on 2026-09-04 after the team concluded that if
 * something happens on the floor, an adult needs a reachable contact just
 * as much as a child does. The only thing carrying that reasoning between
 * those changes was a code comment — and the second change deleted it.
 *
 * A comment cannot fail a build. This can. If someone narrows the rule back
 * to minors without re-taking the decision, the adult-only case below goes
 * red and says why, instead of the change landing silently and a member
 * turning up to a session with nobody to call.
 *
 * The alias loader is what makes this runnable at all: node strips the TS
 * types itself, but not the "@/*" path alias.

 * How check-in works while subscribers hold no booking row.
 *
 * Written for the door, not for developers: short lines, the safeguarding
 * rules first, and the "if this happens" cases someone can actually hit on a
 * Thursday night. It describes the app AS IT IS — including the fact that a
 * subscriber cannot be checked in — rather than as Phase 2 Step 4 will make
 * it. When Step 4 lands and subscribers get real booking rows, rewrite this
 * page in the same commit.

          Why subscribers work this way
        </h2>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm font-semibold text-blue-dark">
          A subscription reserves a place without making a booking, so there is
          no booking for the app to mark as attended. Listing subscribers on the
          register at all is what makes running sessions possible in the
          meantime &mdash; and because that list is read live, cancelling a
          subscription removes someone straight away, with nobody having to
          remember.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm font-semibold text-blue-dark">
          A later release gives subscribers real bookings, and then they check
          in exactly like everyone else. This page changes when that lands.

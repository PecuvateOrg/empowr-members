// Filtering used to be server-side off searchParams, which meant every
// chip tap was a full server navigation with no visual feedback — the
// route reads searchParams, so it could never be prefetched or cached
// and the UI sat completely still for the round trip. The active set is
// single-digit rows, so filtering it in the browser is instant and lets
// /sessions render as a static page.
//
// The URL is still the shareable source of truth, updated through the
// native History API rather than router.push so it does NOT trigger a
// navigation — Next keeps usePathname/useSearchParams in sync with
// history.replaceState.

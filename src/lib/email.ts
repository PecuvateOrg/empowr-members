// Transactional email transport — Resend. members@empowrcic.org is the
// verified sender (the same address Supabase auth SMTP already sends from).
// sendEmail() NEVER throws: an email failure must not fail the caller —
// the Stripe webhook in particular must still return 2xx so Stripe does
// not retry a payment that already confirmed. Failures are logged loudly.
//
// The branded shell and its primitives moved to lib/emails/shell.ts
// 2026-08-28 and are re-exported below, so every existing
// `from "@/lib/email"` import is unchanged. The split exists because this
// module carries `import "server-only"` and pulls in Resend, which made the
// shell unrenderable outside a request — and the Supabase auth email
// templates have to be rendered by a script. See shell.ts for the full why.

// Does a plan's weekly slot cover a given occurrence?
//
// A Subscription is to ONE WEEKLY SLOT — a specific day and time — not to a
// whole offering (Empowr, 2026-08-26). Sk8 Skool for Kidz runs Mondays 16:00
// and Wednesdays 17:00 at £30 each, so a child attending both needs two
// Subscriptions.
//
// ⚠️ THE TRAP THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR: everything must be compared in
// Europe/London. Occurrence times are stored as timestamptz but represent UK
// wall-clock. Comparing in UTC would shift both the hour and, for late-evening
// sessions, the weekday across the BST boundary — so a "Mondays 16:00" slot
// would match for half the year and silently stop matching for the other half,
// quietly un-entitling every subscriber each October.
//
// Pure and dependency-free on purpose, so that behaviour is directly testable
// outside Next — same reasoning as lib/catalogue-filters.ts. No `server-only`.

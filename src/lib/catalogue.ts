// Catalogue reads — anon-safe queries through the cookie-free public
// client (active offerings, scheduled occurrences, venues). Server
// components only.
//
// Every database read here is wrapped in unstable_cache() under a single
// CATALOGUE_TAG. The public catalogue is read on every visit and written
// only by an admin, so serving it from cache turns the hot path from a
// transatlantic round trip into a memory lookup. Admin writes call
// revalidateCatalogue() (lib/revalidate.ts) to drop these entries; the
// revalidate window below is only a backstop in case one is ever missed.
//
// Two deliberate shapes here:
//
//  - The cached queries take no time argument and apply no time filter.
//    Baking new Date() into a cache key would either fragment the cache
//    per-request or freeze "now" into a cached row set. Instead the
//    queries fetch every scheduled row and the callers filter to future
//    ones in memory, so a cache entry stays correct however old it is.
//  - Filtering by type and age also happens in memory, over the full
//    active set, rather than as extra query variants. At single-digit
//    offering counts this is free, and it collapses what would otherwise
//    be a separate cache entry per filter combination into one.

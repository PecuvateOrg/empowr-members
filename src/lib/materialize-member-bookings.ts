// Phase 2 Step 4 — materialise a subscriber's reserved place as a real
// mem_bookings row (source='member', £0, confirmed).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: a Subscription reserves a place with NO booking action
// (Q5, Empowr 2026-08-31). coverForOccurrence() already resolves that live
// for the register and the double-charge refusal — this module does NOT
// duplicate that read. What it fixes is the two things that key off a real
// mem_bookings row and cannot be satisfied by a live read: capacity
// (mem_hold_bookings() only counts booking rows) and check-in (there is no
// control for an entry that doesn't exist).
//
// Reuses slotCoversOccurrence() rather than reimplementing slot matching in
// SQL — that function exists specifically to keep the Europe/London BST trap
// solved in exactly one place. A second, subtly different implementation in
// SQL is the same class of bug this project has shipped three times already
// (checkWaivers, coverForOccurrence).
//
// RECONCILIATION, NOT A DELTA. A participant can hold more than one
// Subscription (e.g. Kidz Monday AND Wednesday), so "cancel this
// membership's bookings" can't be computed from the membership that just
// changed — it has to be "recompute this participant's entitled occurrences
// from ALL their currently-active memberships, then create what's missing
// and cancel what's no longer covered." That is also what makes this safe to
// call repeatedly: idempotent by construction, so a Stripe webhook retry or
// a missed cron tick just re-converges instead of double-booking or racing.
//
// Deliberately does NOT check age eligibility or capacity against
// mem_hold_bookings()'s guard — Q5's answer was that a Subscription reserves
// a place unconditionally, and the register's existing "over capacity"
// banner is the accepted UI for what happens when that collides with a
// full room. This function's insert also has no capacity check for the same
// reason: the subscriber's place takes priority, and it is the PAID
// capacity check (already counting confirmed 'member' rows) that shrinks
// around them, not the other way round.
// ⚠️ DELIBERATELY NO `import "server-only"`, AND THE CLIENT IS INJECTED.
// This module is imported by BOTH the Stripe webhook (a Next.js route) and
// netlify/functions/materialize-member-bookings.ts (a plain esbuild-bundled
// Node function). `server-only` resolves via an exports map: "react-server"
// -> empty.js, "default" -> index.js, and index.js is nothing but a `throw`.
// A Netlify function bundle sets no react-server condition, so it takes the
// default and THROWS AT IMPORT — the nightly sweep would have died on its
// first line every night, in a log nobody reads, while the deploy itself
// reported success. Same reasoning that keeps lib/slot-matching.ts and
// lib/catalogue-read.ts free of the guard: a module that must run outside
// Next cannot carry it. lib/supabase/service.ts keeps its guard, which is
// exactly why the client is passed in rather than constructed here.
